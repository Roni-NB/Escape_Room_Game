**Escape room game. Haunted library. Gather clues.**

This repo consists of 8 html and 4 css files. Page 1 is the library_entrance, and provides users with 3 links/ buttons. The first, and main button - "Click to start" - is linked to the inside_the_library page. The 2 links next to it, "How To Play" and "Game Lore", link to seperate, similar looking, pages, that will provide the promised information. The main page is the inside_the_library page, it is an image of a room in the library; when certain elements of the image are clicked, they take center and are zoomed into. I did this unconventionally: each click moves you to a different page for each clue. The elements are as follows: the bookshelf, the computer, and the ouija board. These are all clues to solve the mystery of the library. This function was created through mapping the coordinates of the picture elements on the page. Therefore, it no longer works when the page isn't full screen at the moment; for that reason, I created a break-point with media-query that results written links to the zoomed-in elements of the page to pop us. Lastly, when you click the light, you move to a different, dimmer page, of the same library image.
